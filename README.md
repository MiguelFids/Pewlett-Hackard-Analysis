Miguel Fidelino

## Purpose
    Deliverable 1: Find the number of retiring employees by title
    Deliverable 2: The employees eligible for the mentorship 
    
## Results

    * There are 72,458 employees that are close to retirement age.
    * Those eligible for mentorship programs from senior employees total 1,549 possible mentees.
    * 1090 Assistant Engineers are to retire. 
    * The majority of staff that are close to retirement are Senior Engineers (25,916) and Regular Engineers (24,926). This makes up 49% of the total retirees. 

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

    Pewlett-Hackard will have an estimated 72,458 retirees. To continue normal operations, we require a total of 72,458 new hires to fill those roles. 

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

    There is a ratio of almost 1:46 mentees to mentors based off current constraints: the mentorship program are for those who have been born on 1965. There appears to be a lack of eligible employees available to be a possible mentee.
